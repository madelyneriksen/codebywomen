### About the Maintainer

I'm [Madelyn Eriksen](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/), a Javascript and Python developer from Los Angeles. I created CodeByWomen to keep track of my favorite blogs and increase visibility of women in tech.

When I'm not programming, I spend my time reading, hiking, and adopting houseplants. If you'd like to stop by and say hi, you can find my website [here!](https://www.madelyneriksen.com/)
